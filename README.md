### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub Repo. Its mainly use to contribute and sometimes i also release things like ansible roles or whatever might be useful for others.

You can find me tooting as <a rel="me" href="https://social.michels.xyz/@sven">@sven@social.michels.xyz</a> on my little Mastodon instance.

Please don't contact me for any Red Hat Products, i'm not a developer at Red Hat.

Stay Healthy!
